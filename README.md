# PA3

Welcome to your third Programming Assignment!

Your **task** is to create three plots that reveal something interesting about either the **diamonds** or **mpg** datasets. For each graph, include the code you used to create the plot, and a one paragraph description of what you found interesting.

In most cases the first plot you try will not be the most informative and you will need to make multiple improvements to get a polished plot. To show this process, please show 3-5 iterations that lead you to this plot.

You can talk about questions with your colleagues in the class, and itâ€™s often useful to get feedback from others on your plots, but everything that you hand in should be yours.

As always, please follow our Honor Code. I expect all homeworks to be unique.
