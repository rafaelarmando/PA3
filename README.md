# PA3

Welcome to your third Programming Assignment!

Your **task** is to create three plots that reveal something interesting about either the **diamonds** or **mpg** datasets. For each graph, include the code you used to create the plot, and a one paragraph description of what you found interesting.

In most cases the first plot you try will not be the most informative and you will need to make multiple improvements to get a polished plot. To show this process, please show 3-5 iterations that lead you to this plot. Now that you have studied *Visualization*, *Transformation*, and *Exploration*, I expect you to use all the tools you have learned to achieve your goal. 

As always, please follow our Honor Code. I expect all Programming Assignments to be unique.
